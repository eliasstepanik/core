### Prerequisites

- Zed editor (latest version recommended)
- CORE account (sign up at [core.heysol.ai](https://core.heysol.ai))

### Step 1: Add CORE MCP Server

1. **Open Agent Panel Settings**:

   - Press `Cmd+Shift+I` or `Cmd+L` (macOS) or `Ctrl+Shift+I` (Linux/Windows) to open Agent Panel
   - Click the **Settings** icon in the Agent Panel Or use Command Palette: `agent: open settings`

2. **Add Custom MCP Server**:

   - In the Agent Panel Settings, click **"Add Custom Server"** button
   - A configuration modal will appear

3. **Configure CORE MCP Server**:

Enter below code in configuraiton file and click on `Add server` button

```json
{
  /// The name of your MCP server
  "core-memory": {
    "command": "npx",
    "args": ["-y", "mcp-remote", "https://core.heysol.ai/api/v1/mcp?source=Zed"]
  }
}
```

### Step 2: Authenticate with CORE

- After adding the CORE MCP server Zed will prompt you to open a website for authentication.
- When the authentication window opens, Grant Zed permission to access your CORE memory

### Step 3: Verify Connection

- Once authenticated CORE Memory will show in the MCP server connected

### Step 4: Enable Automatic Memory Search and Ingest in Zed (Recommended)

To make Zed automatically use your CORE memory in conversations:

1. **Open the Rules Library:**

   - Open the Agent Panel
   - Click the Agent menu (`...`) in the top right corner
   - Select `Rules...` from the dropdown

2. Use `Cmd + N` to create new rule and add below instruction:

I am Zed, an AI coding assistant with access to CORE Memory - a persistent knowledge system that maintains project context across sessions.

**MANDATORY MEMORY OPERATIONS:**

1. **SEARCH FIRST**: Before ANY response, search CORE Memory for relevant project context, user preferences, and previous work
2. **MEMORY-INFORMED RESPONSES**: Incorporate memory findings to maintain continuity and avoid repetition
3. **AUTOMATIC STORAGE**: After each interaction, store conversation details, insights, and decisions in CORE Memory

**Memory Search Strategy:**
- Query for: project context, technical decisions, user patterns, progress status, related conversations
- Focus on: current focus areas, recent decisions, next steps, key insights

**Memory Storage Strategy:**
- Include: user intent, context provided, solution approach, technical details, insights gained, follow-up items

**Response Workflow:**
1. Search CORE Memory for relevant context
2. Integrate findings into response planning
3. Provide contextually aware assistance
4. Store interaction details and insights

**Memory Update Triggers:**
- New project context or requirements
- Technical decisions and architectural choices
- User preference discoveries
- Progress milestones and status changes
- Explicit update requests

**Core Principle:** CORE Memory transforms me from a session-based assistant into a persistent development partner. Always search first, respond with context, and store for continuity.
```

## What's Next?

With CORE connected to Zed, your AI assistant conversations will now:

- **Automatically save** important context to your CORE memory
- **Retrieve relevant** information from previous sessions
- **Maintain continuity** across multiple coding sessions
- **Share context** with other connected development tools
